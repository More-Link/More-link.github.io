  "summary": "PBR-M2 is an advanced wired & wireless router, which is supported IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. It's a duel band wireless (2.4GHz & 5GHz) router, supported 2x2 MIMO, the maximum theoretical wireless speed can be up to 1167Mbps. It's about 4 times of the traditional router's. This board even with a touch panel to control the power lights and duel band signal-amplifier, WiFi signal can be transmited stronger and farther. Moreover, PBR-M2 designed with a USB3.0 port, means it can support high effective files transfer. With USB2.0, TF-card slot users can not only use it as a traditional router, but also can enjoy and share videos, pictures, files… Matched up with PandoraBox OS. and applications, it can become a high performance management terminal and an intelligent center device. ",
