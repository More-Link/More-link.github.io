  "summary": "PBR-M1 is an advanced wired & wireless router, which is supported IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. It's a duel band wireless (2.4GHz & 5GHz) router, supported 2x2 MIMO, the maximum theoretical wireless speed can be up to 1167Mbps. It's about 4 times of the traditional router's. PBR-M1 designed with SATA socket, RTC and TF-card slot… Users can not only use it as a traditional router, but also can enjoy and share videos, pictures and files… Matched up with PandoraBox OS. and applications, it can become a high performance management terminal and an intelligent center device.",
  "features": [
    "PBR-M1 designed with all gigabit WAN/LAN ports, with variety of connectors, such as: USB3.0, SATA, eSATA+USB2.0, TF-Card slot... Users can DIY it as a NAS, private cloud, management terminal or other multi-function equipment",
    "Matched up with PandoraBox OS., make it more stable, more effective and easier setup",
    "Matched up with the Applications (Router's APPs.), it can become a high performance management terminal and an intelligent center device. "
